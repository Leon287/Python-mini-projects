It always seems impossible until it's done.
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week.
Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.
